# Model Monkey

Creating Constructive Chaos for ML Model Endpoints

## Motivation

Machine Learning models are often deployed as RESTful API endpoints.  Model Monkey's job is to provide reassurance those
endpoints are implemented correctly.  Model Monkey provides a framework to test ML model endpoints for correct handling
of values, as well as validation of expected predictions.
